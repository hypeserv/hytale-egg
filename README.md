Panel eggs for hosting Hytale game servers on the HypeServ infrastructure.

## Overview

This egg provides an automated installation and startup configuration for Hytale servers. It handles downloading the Hytale server files, setting up the environment, and starting the server with customizable parameters.

Pterodactyl-based Panels might be compatible if the Version is changed to PTDL_v2, but we will primarily focus on HypeServ Panel and related features that might not be available in Pterodactyl.

## Features

- Automated Hytale server installation
- Automatic download of server files from official sources
- Configurable server parameters
- Easy setup and deployment
- Support for custom asset packs
- Backup management
- Multiple authentication modes

## Server Configuration

The following options can be configured:

| Option | Description | Default |

### First-Time Authentication

During the first start, the Hytale downloader will require authentication with your Hytale account. You'll see output similar to this in the console:

```txt
Please visit the following URL to authenticate:
https://oauth.accounts.hytale.com/oauth2/device/verify?user_code=XXXXXXXX
Or visit the following URL and enter the code:
https://oauth.accounts.hytale.com/oauth2/device/verify
Authorization code: XXXXXXXX
```

**To complete authentication:**

1. Open the provided URL in your web browser
2. Enter the authorization code shown in the console
3. Sign in with your Hytale account credentials
4. Authorize the server to download game files
5. Return to the console - the download will continue automatically

This authentication step is only required during initial setup. Subsequent server starts will not require re-authentication.
