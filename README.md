### First-Time Authentication

During the first start, the Hytale downloader will require authentication with your Hytale account. You'll see output similar to this in the console:

> [!CAUTION]
> **You must have purchased Hytale on the account you are using to authenticate.**

```txt
Please visit the following URL to authenticate:
https://oauth.accounts.hytale.com/oauth2/device/verify?user_code=XXXXXXXX
Or visit the following URL and enter the code:
https://oauth.accounts.hytale.com/oauth2/device/verify
Authorization code: XXXXXXXX
```

**To complete authentication:**

1. Open the provided URL in your web browser
2. Enter the authorization code shown in the console
3. Sign in with your Hytale account credentials
4. Authorize the server to download game files
5. Return to the console - the download will continue automatically

This authentication step is only required during initial setup. Subsequent server starts will not require re-authentication.
